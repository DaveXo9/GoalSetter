# GoalSetter

GoalSetter is a web application built using the MERN stack that empowers users to create, manage, and track their goals effectively. Inspired by the concept of a TODO application, GoalSetter provides a user-friendly interface to organize tasks and progress towards achieving objectives.

Key Features:

Create and Manage Goals:

Users can easily create new goals and set descriptions for each goal. Once created, they can conveniently edit or delete goals based on their progress and changing priorities.

CRUD Operations:

The application supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for goals. This means users can add new goals, update goal descriptions, mark goals as completed, and delete goals when they are no longer needed.

Search Functionality:

GoalSetter includes a robust search feature that enables users to quickly find specific goals by keywords or phrases. This simplifies navigation and helps users keep track of particular tasks or projects.

User Authentication with JWT:

To ensure data security and user privacy, GoalSetter implements user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users must authenticate themselves before accessing their goals or performing any CRUD operations, ensuring that each user's data is protected.
